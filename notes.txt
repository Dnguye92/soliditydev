Blockchain Nodes
	- Geth/Parity/CPP-Eth are examples of Blockchain Nodes
	- They are running client side and are available to download
	- All are implementing th Ethereum Protocol
	- Think of it like  node in a MySQL Cluster
	- Replicating all blocks from the blockchain locally
		- Unless in light client mode

Blockchain Browsers
	- MetaMask/Mist
	- If you want to access a Dapp or something that is utilizing the Ethereum Blockchain then you need to have a browser that enables this connection

Solidity
	- High-level programming language
	- Needs compilation
		- Compiles to EVM Assembly (Byte Code)
	- Looks like JS but isn't JS

Remix
	- It is an IDE in the cloud
		- Remix.ethereum.org
		- Compiles Solidity
		- Has an integrated debugger

WEB3.js, ETHJS
	- These are frameworks or libraries that interact with the blockchain from the browser
	- Both are meant to interact with BC Nodes (JavaScript HTTP-RPC)

Truffle, Embark
	- Frameworks for Solidity
	- Contract management
	- Integrated testing frameworks
	- Truffle Boxes: Pre-configured dev environments

What is the Blockchain??
	- It's the public ledger of all of the Bitcoin transactions that have ever happened dating all the way back to the first transaction
	- All of the transactions are being processed by millions of nodes that are connected to the network from all around the world. This is what makes it a decentralized network.
	- ETH was made with Decentralized Apps in mind whereas BTC was made with the intention to be digital gold or another form of currency
	- Ether is what would power Dapps
	-
